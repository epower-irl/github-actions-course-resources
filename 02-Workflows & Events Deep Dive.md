  - Official doc of Events that trigger worflow: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows

- This Will trigger the worflow if there is
  - "push on any branch or anywhere in the repo.." and
  - also "using workflow dispatch we can trigger the worflow through the button"

  - Link to the above screen shot: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request
  - By default "pull request" activity type triggers when, activity is "opened", "synchronised" or "reopened".
    
  - Example of Activity type, using for "pull request" - which shows that the workflow will trigger only when an "Open PR request is raised"

  - We can triggere event filter on "push" by the following filters as underlined above:
      - branches
      - tags
      - branch-ignore
      - Tag-ignore
        
  - Example of Event trigger:

  - Another examples of adding event triggers(the branches part of "pull request"):

<h3>Final Github worflow code: Having Events filters and activity type asper above exmaples </h3>

<h2> Special Behaviour: Forks & Pull Request Events</h2>

  - If its added as Contributor the flow will excute, but if someone unknown or first time raising PR, the Github worflow will not execute even if the PR is asper the code written in Github worflows.
